## The Beginner's Python Cheatsheet!

This is a reference list of basic Python code, mostly in the context of Data Science and (just a little) Machine Learning.

---

Where I've put in links, these guys have already done a great job of it, so I'll leave it to the experts - just click into it!

Most of this will be quite basic, likely most valuable for beginner individuals just doing a quick Google to figure something out. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, just sufficient for basic purposes.

Standard terms used below - replace with your own:
- _df_ for dataframes
- _file_ for filenames
- _database_ for databases

I try to use pandas where possible, just because I really like how clean it is :)

I am also just still learning so if there are any areas of improvement, please do share.

Enjoy!
