# Python Portfolio

A portfolio of my Python projects for hobby and self-learning.

## Content
### 1) Beginner Python Cheatsheet
A reference list of basic Python code, mostly in the context of Data Science and (just a little) Machine Learning. For beginners (like myself!) to reference.
- [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/yinglinglow/Python/tree/master/Beginner_Python_Cheatsheet)

### 2) Parking Project
A small project as a first trial of my website scraping skills ;) (in progress)
- [Parking information](https://github.com/yinglinglow/Python/blob/master/Parking_Project/Parking_20170918.csv): Carpark names, addresses and fees in CSV
- [Parking information including geo-coordinates](https://github.com/yinglinglow/Python/blob/master/Parking_Project/Parking_20170918_geo.csv): Includes geo coordinates (latitude and longtitude) of each carpark, from Google Maps API

### 3) Hobby Projects
#### Games
- [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/yinglinglow/Python/blob/master/Hobby_Projects/Udemy%20-%20Tic%20Tac%20Toe.ipynb): A game of Tic Tac Toe
- [Blackjack](https://github.com/yinglinglow/Python/blob/master/Hobby_Projects/Udemy%20-%20Blackjack.ipynb): A game of Blackjack

#### Mathematics
- [Project Euler](https://github.com/yinglinglow/Python/blob/master/Hobby_Projects/Project%20Euler.ipynb): Computational problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) (in progress)

#### Learning R after Python

My attempt to play with the Titanic Dataset with both Python (in Jupyter Notebook) and R (in RStudio). It is not so much as to achieve the best prediction, but rather to understand the R syntax. Check the notebooks out [here](https://github.com/yinglinglow/Python/tree/master/Python_to_R_Project)! (in progress)
